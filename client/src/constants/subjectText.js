    'Imagine that a singer sings the same note twice, one an octave above the other. \n' +
    'You can hear a difference between these two sounds. \n' +
    'That is because their pitch is different.\n' +

    'Pitch depends on the frequency of a sound wave.\n' +
    'Frequency is the number of wavelengths that fit into one unit of time.\n' +
    'Even though the singer sang the same note, because the sounds had different frequencies, we heard them as different. \n' +
    'Frequencies are measured in hertz. \n' +
    'One hertz is equal to one cycle of compression and rarefaction per second. \n' +
    'High sounds have high frequencies and low sounds have low frequencies. \n' +
    'Thunder has a frequency of only 50 hertz, while a whistle can have a frequency of 1,000 hertz.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The human ear is able to hear frequencies of 20 to 20,000 hertz.\n' +
    'Some animals can hear sounds at even higher frequencies.\n' +
    'The reason we cannot hear dog whistles, while they can, is because the frequency of the whistle is too high or too low be processed by our ears.';
